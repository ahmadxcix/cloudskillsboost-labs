# 🌥️ Cloud Skills Boost Labs – GCP Hands-On Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on labs, notebooks, and guided exercises completed through **[Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/)**. It serves as a curated archive of my practical work in **data engineering**, **generative AI**, **ML pipelines**, and **cloud-native architecture** using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

> 🧠 *These labs complement my ongoing professional journey toward designing resilient, scalable data platforms and real-time analytics solutions using GCP-native services.*
