# 🛠️ Data Engineering Labs

This section contains hands-on labs focused on **batch processing**, **real-time streaming**, and **pipeline orchestration** using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools.

Each lab demonstrates how to design scalable, secure, and automated data workflows using GCP-native services like:

- **BigQuery** – Analytics and warehousing
- **Dataflow** – Streaming and batch pipelines (Apache Beam)
- **Pub/Sub** – Real-time messaging
- **Cloud Composer** – Workflow orchestration (Apache Airflow)

## 📂 Subfolders

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`batch-processing/`](./batch-processing) | Load and transform data in batch using Cloud Storage, Dataflow, and BigQuery |
| [`streaming-dataflow/`](./streaming-dataflow) | Build real-time pipelines using Pub/Sub and Dataflow |
| [`data-orchestration-composer/`](./data-orchestration-composer) | Schedule and monitor workflows with Cloud Composer (Airflow) |

Each folder contains:
- Notebook/code (cleaned of creds)
- `README.md` describing objectives, architecture, tools, and learnings
