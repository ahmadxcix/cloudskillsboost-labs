# üß† Prompt Design with Vertex AI (Gemini API)

This notebook is part of the **"Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design"** lab on [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/86501?parent=catalog).  
It explores prompt engineering techniques using **Vertex AI's Gemini models**, demonstrating how to craft effective prompts that improve the quality and reliability of LLM-generated responses.

## üìå Overview

This lab focuses on prompt engineering and best practices for designing effective prompts to improve the quality of your responses from large language models (LLMs). You‚Äôll learn to:

- Write prompts that are **concise, specific, and well-defined**
- Focus prompts on **a single task**
- Convert **generative tasks into classification tasks**
- Use **examples (few-shot)** to enhance model outputs

You will also explore advanced GenAI capabilities via **Gemini Pro** and **Gemini Flash** models through the Vertex AI SDK.

## üß† Gemini Models Overview

| Model        | Use Case Highlights |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Gemini Pro**   | Complex reasoning, summarizing large documents, codebase understanding |
| **Gemini Flash** | Fast, efficient responses; optimized for low-latency multimodal tasks |

These models are accessible via the **Gemini API in Vertex AI**, which provides a unified interface for building generative AI applications.
